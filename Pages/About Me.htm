      <blockquote> 
        <p>Welcome to my website. I hope you will have a look around and enjoy 
          yourself. I've spent my whole life working towards what I am today.</p>
        <p>On April 24th, 1985, the world welcomed T. Russell Heimlich into the 
          world. I was born and raised in Columbia Maryland, right smack-dab in 
          the middle of Baltimore and Washington. My early childhood years were 
          spent playing with Legos and developing my imagination. In elementary 
          school I was interested in art, but still payed attention to the other 
          subjects. In fifth grade (1996) I started skateboarding, and my creativity 
          took off.</p>
        <p>After two years of good fun and dedication skateboarding led me to 
          my first video camera, which was also my first creative outlet. On Christmas 
          day, 1998, my parents surprised me with a Sony Hi-8 camcorder to record 
          the antics of my friends and I. Videotaping led to video editing and 
          I quickly became involved with non-linear editing on my computer. in 
          1998 I won the grandprize for a video editing contest sponsored by the 
          biggest skateboarding video magazine in the industry, <a href="http://www.411vm.com" target="_blank">411vm</a>. 
          My reward was a free trip to skate camp in Visalia California. This 
          great honor was the driving force pushing me onward in my creative career.</p>
        <p>High school helped me further my craft, but there were no video classes 
          being offered, so I had to learn everything on my own. My friends were 
          failing chemistry class sophmore year and needed something to bring 
          their grade up in a hurry. They came up with the idea for a video, and 
          I helped them produce it. The project was a huge success, everyone loved 
          it! (Even though there wasn't much chemistry in the video) The Chemistry 
          Video spawned <a href="http://www.h-cubed.web1000.com" target="_blank">H-Cubed 
          Productions</a> and the following year we produced a sequel entitled 
          The Physics Video. Once again, another hit. </p>
        <p>By senior year (2003) I had decided that I want to make a career out 
          of video editing and enrolled in the mentor program. I was set up with 
          the owner of a small production boutique called <a href="http://www.coastalstudio.com/" target="_blank">Coastal 
          Productions</a>. For the whole year of my study I learned the ins and 
          out of a real-life working video house. My final project was a documentary 
          about an annual mentor conference along with a short commercial for 
          the promotion of the mentor program. </p>
        <p>In the same year I produced &quot;Be Careful What You Wish For&quot;, 
          a humerous short film featuring three men stranded on a snowy mountain. 
          I published the film to <a href="http://www.triggerstreet.com" target="_blank">Triggerstreet.com</a> 
          and entered a DVD version with behind the scenes footage to <a href="http://www.videomaker.com" target="_blank">Videomaker 
          Magazine</a> for their 17th annual short video contest. I won an honorable 
          mention for BEST DVD.</p>
        <p>Over the summer I met a wedding videographer and worked as his assistant 
          on various jobs. My responsibilites included setting-up/packing-down 
          and videotaping B-Roll footage. This is where I developed my camera 
          skills while working with a Sony VX-2000.</p>
        <p>In the late fall of 2003 I moved to Philadelphia to attend The Art 
          Institute of Philadelphia where I am currently pursuing a major in Digital 
          Media Production. I am actively involved with the <a href="http://di.atspace.com" target="_blank">Digital 
          Icons Production Club</a> and various freelance opportunities around 
          the area.</p>
